# What is an Open reading frame(ORF)
Open reading frame is a sequence in genetic code that codes for amino acid. ORF starts from start codon AUG nad ends at stop codon UGA or UAG or UAA. 
Open reading frame is a sequence of genetic code start with AUG start codon and countinues with codons that codes for amino acid in protein on translation and stops at stop codon.

# why start codon and stop codon define ORFs
Start codon and stop codon define ORFs because according to ORF a correct DNA sequence or its RNA transcription sequence is that which start with start codon , continues with amino acid tranlating codon and stops at a point of stop codon.
The presence of ORFs in nucleotides sequence ensures it produces functional protein from amino acid polypeptide chain on translation through reading codons on mRNA sequence.

# How a single mutation destroy ORF
A single mutation can affect ORF in a subsquently way. Insertion or deletion in DNA sequence leads to shift in reading frame and reults in formation of non-functiuonal or truncate protein on translation.
Production of non-functional protein changes the phenotype of organisms as compared to wild type, which is more common in environment. Protein is building block of body, it leads every cellular level functions of cell in organsms.
For example:- mRNA sequence 5' AUGUUUGUAUAA 3', this sequence is shows open reading frame as it start with start codon(AUG), continues with codon which code for amino acid such as UUU codes for Phenyline(F), and GUA codes for valine and this sequence ends with stop codon UAA.This sequence gives two amino acid on translation.

if this sequence mutated for example:- 5' AUCGUUUGUAUAA 3', in this sequence there is no AUG start codon, because of mutation, addition of single nucleotide base (C) at third position in this sequence destroys ORF. Also due this mutation this sequence will not generetate any amino acid on translation becuase of absence of start codon which signals ribosomes for start the translation at this point.
From above both examples its show how a single a point mutation if it is addition or deletion of nucleotide in sequence destroy Open reading frame.
