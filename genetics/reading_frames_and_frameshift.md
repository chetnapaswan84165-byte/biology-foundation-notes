# What is a reading frame
Reading frame is a way of read nucleotide of DNA sequence in the multiple of 3 know as codon or triplets.
Reading frame is defines as specific sequence of nucleotide triplets(codons), that are read during the procese of protein syntheis, dictating the amino acid sequence of polypeptide chain.

#The triplet code: The genetic code is a triplet code, means each amino acids in protein is specified by three nucleotide also known as codon.
Given nucleotide sequence for 4^3 = 64 codon, where 61 codon available for code for amino acids and remaining three codes for terminating the proccess as stop codon. 
The reading frame stabiliesh how these codon  are grouped and interprited. Because the sequence of nuclotide is continuous, there are three reading frames for given strand of DNA or RNA. 

The initiation and start codon: The correct reading frames got know only by the presence of start codon AUG in the given sequence, AUG also codes for amino acid methionine. This start codon(AUG) signals ribosomes to begin translation at this specific point in mRNA sequence, estabilishing the correct sequence of amino acid.
# For example: mRNA sequence 5' AUGCGAUGA 3' is code for as first three nuclotide or codon AUG code for start the process when mature mRNA go for the translation process to ribosome and ribosome scan the mRNA sequence by this start codon and start the coding or protein synthesis process at that specific point of AUG. After AUG it is CGA it code for any amino acid, afte that UGA left and it codes for termination act as stop codon, and the process of translation stop and a new protein formed. 

# How frameshift changes protein output
Due to frameshift mutation whole sequence gets distrupt and complicate reading frame. Frameshit mutation happens in two ways insertion and deletion. Insertion or deletion of three nuclotides or a set of codon if happens so it not affect much the process or it not cause any  complication. 
But deletion of one base or nucleotide in sequence lead to form a stop codon in sequence or it can low the production of specific amino acid from that sequence. 
# example : In mRNA sequence 5' AUGCGAUGA 3' is mutated by deletion of "U" nucleotide at first place after "A" nucleotide. Now it becomes 5' AGCGAUGA 3'. This mutation incorrect the whole sequence of mRNA now it will not able to procedd further because of unavailability of AUG codon for start the process of translation. 
But if deletion happens of 3 base pair or a set of codon, such as in this seuence 5' AUGCGAUGA 3' due to mutation CGA codon removed. Now it become 5' AUGUGA 3 sequence, here in this sequence we have AUG in starting for act as start codon and at last we have UGA which act as stop codon. So this type of mutation a frameshift or dletion of set of codon not lead any specific type of somplication, this type of mutation not affect much.

In Insertion, a single base or nuclotide add in the mRNA sequence and it disturb reading frame also lead to production of non functional protein or stop codon, as it turncate protein synthesis.
# For example: In mRNA sequence 5' AUGCGAUAGUGA 3' is mutated by addition of one nucleotide "A" in the middle of sequence form the sequence as 5' AUGCGAUAAGUGA 3'. Now in this sequence it start as AUG and it code as start codon. Then it is CGA it code for amino acid, and after this it is UAA and this codon act as stop codn and it will stop the process in middle becuase of the presence of UAA stop codon in the middle due to insertio of nucleotide. Due to mutation whole sequence will not translate and not form their protein from that sequence which supposed to be form by that sequence.
If insertion or addition happen of a set of codon there is not much affect happend but it can lead to excess formation of any amino acid. 
So, in this way frameshift mutation changes protein output.
