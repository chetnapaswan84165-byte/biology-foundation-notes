# DNA Replication

# What is DNA replication?
DNA replication is a process in which DNA double helix strand seprate and form new strands and form new complimentary DNA(Daughter DNA) from parental DNA. 

# Why replication is necessary?
Replication is necessary for transfer of equal amount of DNA during cell division.

# Steps in the process of Replication
Initiation: Fistly start the process of DNA replication by finding out the origin of replication. We can't start replication from anywhere, there is always a site or origin of replication in the DNA strand from where DNA replication process start. 
Elongation: After finding origin of replication we elongate or stretched out the strands from that origin, by breaking the hydrogen bond between nucleotides. 
Termination: DNA primes are inttroduced at the position of replication and it form strands identical/complimentary to the parental strands. This is also known as semiconservative DNA replication.

# Enzymes involved:
Helicase: Helicase use to break the helical structure formed through hydrogen bonds. Basically helicase break the hydrogen bonds between the nucleotides seperating both the strands from each other.
DNA polymerase: It is uses the DNA to catylase the polymeraisation of deoxynucleotides. During the process of replication DNA polymerase use to polymerase the hydrogen bond.
Ligase: It use to glued or stich the okijaka strands, Basically it use to join the complemetart DNA strands to template strand.

# One common error during replication
A error always came during replication, when DNA form its complimentary strand one side of strand form without any complication countinuously but second side of strand form discountinuously and here we need to be more careful because one error in the replication form mutation and cause abnormalities in the DNA or it will not work like other DNA strand if it get mutated.
