# What is Transcription/ What happened in transcription?
The process of copying the genetic matrial from one strand of the DNA to RNA is known as transcription. There is only one segment of the one strand of DNA copying to generate the RNA. 
From the double helix structure of DNA only one strand which has polarity (3'-->5') selected to works as a template strand and other strand with polarity(5'-->3') work as a coding strand. There is two segment of this strand one is promoter and second one is terminator. 
Promoter is the region from whcih transcription starts(3'-->5') polarity of the template strand.
Terminator is the region of completing the process or terminate the process at the end.
In the process of trranscription there is 3 steps:

Intition: In this process RNA polymerase with a mRNA strand with sigma factor intiate this process by entering from the prmoter region(3'-->5').

Elongation:RNA polymerase then strect or elongate the double helix structure of DNA.

Termination:After elongation the mRNA strand fell out and aslo with this RNA poymerase with rho factor came out and this is known as termination.

# What happens in translation?
Conversion of mRNA to protein this process is known as translation. After getting matures mRNA(messenger RNA) from the process of transcription, the rRNA(ribosomal RNA) perform it's role to convert this mRNA to proteins. The mRNA strand get 
Translation is a process of polymerisation of amino acids to form poypeptides. The ribososmes is knows as the cellular factory of protein synthesis. Ribosomal consists RNA and 80 amino acids. In its inactive form it exist in two subunits a smaller subunit and a larger subunit. 
Smaller subunit strats the process of translation through stick to mRNA AUG codon the strat codon to from amino acids with polypetide bond. After smaller subunit the larger subunit came in action and perform the next procedure to converting the DNA strand to its meanigful or respecting polypetides. 

# Why error matters in genetics>
Errors matters in genetics because a small chage a cause a big disease or abnormalities. Tf there is small error happen in genetic makeup it will make a big difference and cause mutation. And mutation lead to form many harmful genetic disorders and cause complication in the living organism.
