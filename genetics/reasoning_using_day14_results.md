# Did both RNAs produce ORFs?
Yes, both RNA sequence can produce ORFs despite sequence differences, because ORF detection depends on reading frame structure rather than overall sequnce identity.
RNAs can produce ORFs even if their sequences are different, as long as they contain a valid start codon and an unninterrupted coding region.

# Was the stop codon position conserved?
No, stop codon position is not conserved. As one RNA sequnce lacks a corresponding stop codon, leading to a non-terminated ORF.

# Did protein length change significantly?
Yes, Protein length change significantly, indicating disruption of the coding region, likely due to mutation affecting translation termination.

# Based on this alone, is function likely conserved?
No, function is unlikely to be conserved because significant changes in protein length and loss of proper termination strongly suggest functional disruption.
Loss of stop codon or major protein length change usually breaks function. Function conservation correlates with protein length and domain preservation.
Based on these observations, functional conservation is unlikely, as proper protein length and termination are critical for maintaining biological function.
