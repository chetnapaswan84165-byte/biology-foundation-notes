# ORF conservation
ORF conservation is evolutionary preservation of open reading frames that encode for functional proteins. 
ORFs that encodes protein which are essential for survival is accumulate less disruptive mutations over time due to purifying selection.
As a result only long ORFs without any premature stop codon are conserved across related species because disruption would reduce fitness.

# Orthologus genes
Orthologus genes are genes in different species that originated from a single gene in the last common ancestors and diverged due to speciation. 
Orthologus typically retain similar biological functions across species, making them central to comparative genomics and functional annotation.

# Frameshift vs Nonsense mutation
Frameshift mutation is a mutation in which nucleotides are inserted or deleted in numbers not diisible by three, shifting the reading frame. 
This alters all downstream codons and usually introduces a premature stop codon, leading to severly truncated and nonfunctional protein.

Nonsense mutation is a type of point mutation in which a codon encoding an amino acid is converted into stop codon. This mutation cause premature 
termination of translation and results in a shortened protein that is often nonfunctional.

# State why protein length similarity matters more than nucleotide similarity
Protein length similarity is often more informative than nucleotide similarity because the genetic code is degenerate, allowing different nucleotide sequences to encode the same amino acids. Silent mutations can alter DNA without changing protein sequence or function. In contrast, changes that affect protein length usually indicate frameshifts or nonsense mutations, which atrongly impact protein structure and function and are therefore under stronger selective pressure.
