# DNA Mutation
A sudden change in genetic makeup cause mutation. Basically a change in DNA sequence leads to mutation. 
This mutation cause changes genetically and pheotypic. Mutation result in change in the function of gene on genetically and morphologicaly(physical).
## Point Mutation
Definition: A change in a single base pair of DNA cause Point mutation. 
Example: A classical example of point mutation is sickel cell anemia cause the chage in the shape of red blood cells. A change in beta globin chain in dna sequence result in the formation of glutamine instead valine during the formation of proteins from amino acids.  
Effect on protein: A single base pair change in the DNA sequence result in shift in the reading frame and could result in formation of different protein.
  Normal sequence                               Mutated sequence
DNA sequence 3' AGCTACGGCCTAC 5'           3' AGCTAtGGCCTAC 5'
mRNA sequence 3'UCGAUGCCGGAUG 5'           3' UCGAUaCCGGAUG 5'

## Frameshift Mutations 
Defination: A change in base pair due to insertion or deletion changes in the frameshift reading of DNA sequence causes Frameshift mutation.Due to insertion or deletion changes in reading frameshift not divisible by  3. 
Example: Cystic Fibrosis, a condition in which mutation in CTFR gene disturpt in the protein function.
Effect on protein: If it is insertion of a base pair(3 nucleotide) in the dna sequence can cause the formation of a protein whcich is not supposed to form in that sequence or it can be form extra protein.
                   If it is deletion of a base pair(3 nucleotide) in the dna sequence can cause the less production/formation of a protein.

## Types Based on Effect 
-Silent Mutation: A point mutaion which not affect dna sequence basically this mutation not affect in protein formation that's why it is called silent mutation.
-Missense mutation: A mutation in which addition of different codon and it cause to the production of different protein.
-Nonsense mutation: In this mutation a codon chages to a Stop codon. 

## Why Mutations matter in Disease
Beacuse mutation cause not easily curable diseases, it could be life taking disease. Mutation could result in genetically and morphologically diseases and these disease inherit to next generation. Change in DNA sequence transfer mutated gene to next generation and disease easily transmit from generation to generation.
