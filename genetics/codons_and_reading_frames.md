# What a codon is 
Codon is a set of three nucleotides also known as triplets. Each triplets code for different amino acids and for begining and terminating the translation process.
There is unique Start codon AUG code for start the process of translation, by reading this AUG codon in mRNA, ribosomes start the process of formation or synthesis amino acids. 
Also there is STOP Codon UAA, UAG, UGA three codon codes for terminating the process of translation, act as STOP codon for stoping.

# Why reading frames matter
Firstly Reading frame is a way nucleotides in DNA and in RNA sequences group set of three(triplet). In this sequence reading triplets correctly play a major role
because each codon or triplets code for synthesyes different amino acids or proteins and stop codon at the time of translation. Reading frame sequence starts from 5'-->3' direction. And nucleotides sequence read through the multiple of three.
Reading frames matter most because it decides which amino acid synthesis from which codon. Codon also code for begigning the process of translation from mRNA know as start codon and it also code for terminating tranlation process know as stop codon.
So, if we read the nucleotide frame wrong because of mutation or error it will produce non functional or truncate protein.
There is  three way of reading a codon, but in DNA double helix structure there is six way of reading frame, three ways from coding strand and other three ways from complimetary strand.

# How mutation affect reading frames
Mutation affect in reading frames cause genetics and morphologic changes in organisms, make their body unfit for survival naturally.
Reading frames read the codon and according to that codon codes for protein, stop and start. But if due to insertion or deletion of one or more nuclotides bases complicate the reading it could code for stop codon or some non-functional protein.
For example : a DNA sequence 3' TACGACATC 5' is mutated during transcription by inserting a base(C) in this sequence and form a mutated mRNA 5' AUGCUCGUAG 3', which disturb reading frame and it will code not properly and also due to mutation or addition of a base makes the sequence not readable for stop codon become not readable.
