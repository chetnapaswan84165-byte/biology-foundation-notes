# What translation produces
Tranlation produces amino acids join with each other with polypeptide bond and this polypeptide chain then forms a new protein.

# Why codon table is neede
Codon table tells us which codon code for which amino acid. As we know that each codon code for specific amino acid and there are 64 codons total. In which 61 codon code for amino acids and 3 codon codes as STOP codon.
In codon table it states that which each unique codon code for different amino acid. Beacause of codon table we can get to know which codon form which amino acid.

# One challenge in automating translation
Automating translation is done in machines or computers. Automating translation involves use of technologies such as machine translation and generative AI based models on  Large Language models(LLMs).
Automating translation has limitation it only works on existing data. If it is new rare case happen then automating translation fials here it will not accurately solve the new problem. Beacuse it works on existing data and because of ai it explores more but it is only on machines, it can solve issues but only on machines it don't know waht effect it going to happen on that body.
