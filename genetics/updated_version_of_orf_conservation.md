ORF conservation:-  Open reading frames refers to preservation of an uninterrupted coding region that maintains the same reading frame and produces a functional protein across species or evolutionary time.
What does it mean evloutionarily
ORF conservation indicates that the protein encoded is essential for survival or fitness, so natural selection maintains its integrity across generations. Natural selection removes mutations that disrupt essential ORFs.

Why long ORFs are selected
Long ORFs are more likely to encodes functional proteins. Random sequnces rarely maintain long uninterrupted coding stretches unless they are biologically important. Long ORFs are statistically unlikely by chance, therefore long conserved ORFs are strong evidence of real genes.


What breaks conservation
Mutations such as frameshift, nonsense, insertion/deletion, start codon loss, premature polyadenylation, splice-site mutation or recombination events can disrupt the ORF, leading to loss of function.

Orthologus Genes:- Orthologus genes are genes in different species that originated from a common ancestor and diverged after a speciation event.
Orthologs vs Paralogs:- 
Orthologs: Genes in different species derived from a common ancestor that usually retain the same function.
Paralogs: Genes produced by duplication within the same genome, which often diverge to perform different functions.

Why orthologs are used for functional prediction:
Orthologs are used for functional predictions because they tend to conserve function across species, making them reliable for inferring gene roles in newly studies organisms.

Frameshift vs Nonsense Mutation
Frame shift mutation: Caused by insertion or deletion of nucleotides not in multiple of three, shifting the reading frame. This usually alters every downstream codon, producing a completely different(often nonfunctional) protein.
Non-sense mutation: A single nucleotide change that converts a codon into a stop codon, prematurely truncating the protein.

Which is more damaging
Frameshift are udually more damaging bacause they disrupt the entire downstream sequence, often eliminating protein function completely. On the other hand, Nonsense mutation truncate the protein but may leave part of it functional if the stop codon occurs late.

Why evolution selects against one more strongly:
Frameshifts are more strongly selected against because they almost always abolish protein function, whereas nonsensense mutaion sometimes allow partial activity if truncation is near the end.
