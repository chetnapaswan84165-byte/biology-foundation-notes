ORF conservation:-  Open reading frames refers to preservation of coding sequences across species or lineage. It means DNA sequence continues to encodes funtional protein without disruption. 
What does it mean evloutionarily
ORF conservation indicates that the protein encoded is essential for survival or fitness, so natural selection maintains its integrity across generations.

Why long ORFs are selected
Long ORFs are more likely to encodes functional proteins. Random sequnces rarely maintain long uninterrupted coding stretches unless they are biologically important.


What breaks conservation
Mutations such as frameshift, nonsense, insertion/deletion or recombination events can disrupt the ORF, leading to loss of function.

Orthologus Genes:- Orthologus genes are genes in different species that originated from a common ancestor and diverged after a speciation event.
Orthologs vs Paralogs:- Orthologus are those which have genes originated from common ancestor and it perform different functions. Whereas Paralogs are those which genetically diversify. 

Why orthologs are used for functional prediction:
Orthologs are used for functional predictions because they tend to conserve function across species, making them reliable for inferring gene roles in newly studies organisms.

Frameshift vs Nonsense Mutation
Frame shift mutation: Caused by insertion or deletion of nucleotides not in multiple of three, shifting the reading frame. This usually alters every downstream codon, producing a completely different(often nonfunctional) protein.
Non-sense mutation: A single nucleotide change that converts a codon into a stop codon, prematurely truncating the protein.

Which is more damaging
Frameshift are udually more damaging bacause they disrupt the entire downstream sequence, often eliminating protein function completely. On the other hand, Nonsense mutation truncate the protein but may leave part of it functional if the stop codon occurs late.

Why evolution selects against one more strongly:
Frameshifts are more strongly selected against because they almost always abolish protein function, whereas nonsensense mutaion sometimes allow partial activity if truncation is near the end.
