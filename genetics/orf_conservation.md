# What is ORF conservation 
ORF is a long stretch of codons without any distubance of stop codon in middle, that ORF codes for functional proteins, and futher these proteins play major role for performing basic cellular functions in organisms.
These ORF are Naturally selected ORF in every organisms or strains over a evolutionay period of time from our ancestors. No matter what changes in climate happened, there is always  ORF remain in every organisms.
A conserve ORF means having DNA/RNA sequence and the protein it encodes remain very similar whether it goes through evolution. Identifying proteins which perform basic and important cellular function across every organisms and selecting it or maintaing it without any mutation in cells or in organisms body is known as conserving ORF.

# Why it is biologically important
ORF conservation is biologically important because it plays significant role in every organisms. Conserve ORF codes for functional proteins which are essential for cellular functions in every organisms. Maintaing the similarity across all organisms and their functions. Mutation leads to disrupt ORF and it will codes for non-functional protein, also mutation could be harmless such as silent mutation and could be lethal such as frameshift mutation.Naturally these mutation are eliminated to make produce only functional proteins. So, conserving ORF is compolsury for maintaing stability for survival and adapbility for evolution over a period of time across every organisms.

# One question or insight while I read about this 
I got to know that in every living being present on this planet have same ORFs. Proving that every organisms have orthologus genes. Having similarity in gene, still every orgainsms belongs to different species perform different and unique functions. I have a question, Is that every whether it is multicellular or unicecllular organisms have same ORF. Is this possible that unicellular organisms have that ORFs which also present in multicellular orgainsms. Both have different cellular organisation performing different functions, so how could be it possible that only some or just a point of difference brings lot of changes?
