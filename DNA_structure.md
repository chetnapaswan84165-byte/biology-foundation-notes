#DNA Structure

What is DNA
Full form of DNA is - Deoxyribonucleic acid. It is found in nucleus of a cell. It is a genetic material, means it transfer from one generation to other or we can say it inheiret. DNA stores instruction required to perform many activities within the cell, such as growth, matabolish, development, and functioning of an organisms. 
## Components of DNA 
Sugar : The sugar present in DNA is known as 2-deoxyribose. Means it said that in DNA at the 2' carbon it is a lack of sugar molecule or an oxygen atom. This absence of an oxygen atom is crucial for the stability of the DNA molecule. 
Phosphate group: It provides structural integrity and stability to the DNA molecule. It is a tetrahedral structure with a phosphorus atom bonded to four oxygen atoms(PO4).
Nitrogenous Base: Nitrogenous base are organic molecules that contain nitrogen and are essential components of nucleotides, they built DNA and RNA.
##Nitrogenous Bases 
Adenine :A purine base that pairs with thymine in DNA through two hydrogen bonds. 
Thymine:A pyrimidine base that pairs with adenine, providing stability to DNA structure. 
Guanine:It pairs with cytosine, playing a vital role in the genetic code.
Cytosine:It pairs with guanine through three hydrogen bonds, contributing to the overall stability of the DNA double helix.
##Double Helix Structure
 DNA is double stranded structure. It consists of two spiral chains of deoxyribonucleic acid twisted around one another, resembling a spiral staircase and forming twisted ladder shape.Each strand of DNA is composed of nucleotides, which includes nitrogenous base, a five carbon sugar, and phosphate group. These two strands are held together through hydrogen bonds between nitrogenous base. The importance of the structure of DNA it encodes instructions for building proteins which are essential for the structure and function of cells.
 ## Importance of DNA structure
 Structure of the DNA provides stability. The double helix structure of DNA is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between nitrogenous base pairs.The double helix structure of DNA allows for accurate replication through complementary base pairing. These base pairing each code for its respective proteins shows genetic information. And these codes or base pairing is crucial for inheritance. It pairs to their respective pairing and transform the genetics material from one generation to next generation.
 ## Questions I still Have
 How and from what these nucelotides form?
 Why it is twisted structure?
 Why it is necessary for having ladder shape structure.
